# Kvasir-Seg-PolypSegmentation
One of the main causes of death due to cancer worldwide is colorectal cancer . The most common method for locating, identifying, and removing colorectal polyps is a colonoscopy. When doing a colonoscopy, doctors frequently miss colorectal polyps because of their variety in size, shape, and similarity to surrounding tissue. Automated polyp segmentation can reduce missed rates and allow for early detection and treatment of colon cancer. Physicians may find it easier to identify polyps during a colonoscopy examination with the aid of Artificial Intelligence-based Computer Aided Diagnostics. In this work,we try  to study polyp segmentation and build an efficient and accurate segmentation model. We Use the U-net model along with some other pre-trained model as encoder of U-net model. We have achieved IOU score of 77.29\% using mobilenetV2 as encoder for UNET model.
