# Kvasir-Seg-PolypSegmentation
Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. A colonoscopy is the most popular technique for finding, detecting, and eliminating colorectal polyps. Due to their variability in size, shape, and resemblance to surrounding tissue, colorectal polyps are often overlooked by physicians during colonoscopies. Early colon cancer identification and treatment are made possible by automated polyp segmentation, which can also lower missed rates. Artificial intelligence based computer aided diagnostics may make it easier for doctors to spot polyps during a colonoscopy test. In this work,we try  to study polyp segmentation and build an efficient and accurate segmentation model. We Use the U-net model along with some other pre-trained model as encoder of U-net model. We have achieved IOU score of 77.29\% using mobilenetV2 as encoder for UNET model.
